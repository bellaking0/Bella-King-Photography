<p>My most recent <a href="https://youtu.be/a8m40lIg6VY">video reel</a> is from 2019 and contains footage I took on a study abroad trip to Tokyo, Japan as well as clips from my first short film, <i>Smells Like American Spirits</i>.</p>
<p>I have been a photographer for the last six years and have been honing in on my craft since then with my primary focus on live music and portraits. My <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHsmb9G3Tu">photography portfolio</a> features the wide range of events I have taken pictures atand portraits.</p>
