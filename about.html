	<p>
I aim to showcase nostalgia and the impermanence of our surroundings through my photography and my film projects. I would like to create a world where nostalgia and the acknowledgement of nothing is truly ours forever can coincide. I offer high quality photography and cinematography as well as proficient in sound and light production. 

As an artist, I try to capture the most candid image of my subject as possible. Whether it is through video or photographs. I want to create work that has a sense of the real rather than a sense of fiction. As a mixed person, I always felt out of place from both of my identities as I never felt fully of either. I want to highlight that as well as reflecting on my own past has been a massive part of my own reflexive works.
